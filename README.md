# Photometric Redshifts Estimation

## Project Overview

This project focuses on estimating photometric redshifts, which are crucial for studying the large-scale structure of the universe and the distribution of galaxies. It employs Gaussian processes as a flexible non-parametric approach to effectively model uncertainties in photometric data. The project also integrates various data analysis techniques to enhance accuracy and performance, offering a comprehensive framework for photometric redshift estimation.

## Features

- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Leverage Gaussian processes to estimate redshifts, allowing for a quantifiable measure of uncertainties.
- **Data Handling and Preprocessing**: Tools for cleaning and preparing synthetic datasets based on the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
- **Advanced Data Analysis**: Combines Gaussian processes with other statistical and machine learning techniques to enhance predictive power.
- **Visualization Tools**: Includes tools for visualizing redshift distributions, error margins, and overall model performance.
- **Thorough Documentation**: Detailed explanations and example notebooks for easy understanding and reproducibility.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Python 3.8+
- **Key Packages**: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, GPflow

# Photometric Redshifts Estimation

This project focuses on estimating photometric redshifts.
## Project Overview

Photometric redshift estimation is essential for understanding the universe's large-scale structure and distribution of galaxies. Gaussian processes offer a flexible, non-parametric approach to model the uncertainties inherent in photometric data, while additional data analysis techniques enhance accuracy and performance. This project explores and implements these methods, providing a comprehensive framework for photometric redshift estimation.

## Features

- **Gaussian Process Regression**: Implements Gaussian processes to estimate redshifts with quantifiable uncertainties.
- **Data Handling and Preprocessing**: Includes methods to clean and prepare synthetic datasets based on SDSS.
- **Multiple Data Analysis Techniques**: Combines Gaussian processes with other statistical and machine learning methods to optimize predictions.
- **Visualization**: Tools to visualize redshift distributions, error margins, and model performance.
- **Documentation and Tutorials**: Detailed explanations and example notebooks for ease of understanding and reproducibility.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Key packages: NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, and GPflow

## Metrics

Hereâ€™s how each metric aligns with standard practices for evaluating machine learning models:

1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: A standard loss function commonly used to evaluate prediction accuracy. It measures the average squared difference between predicted and actual values.

   $$
   \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2
   $$

2. **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Complementary to MSE, this metric measures the average absolute difference between predicted and actual values. It is less sensitive to outliers compared to MSE.

   $$
   \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\hat{y}_i - y_i|
   $$

3. **$R^2$ (Coefficient of Determination)**: Assesses how well the model explains the variance in the data. It is a critical metric for evaluating the goodness of fit.

   $$
   R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
   $$

4. **Bias**: Reflects systematic errors in predictions. A lower bias indicates the model makes consistent predictions without systematic shifts.

   $$
   \text{Bias} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - y_i)
   $$

5. **Precision**: In regression tasks, precision refers to the variability in repeated predictions or the model's ability to tightly group results around the true values. It can be quantified by the standard deviation of the predictions.

   $$
   \text{Precision} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y}_i - \bar{\hat{y}})^2}
   $$

6. **Catastrophic Outlier Fraction (COF)**: Measures the proportion of predictions that significantly deviate from the true values. This metric is especially important in astrophysics, where outliers can mislead scientific interpretations.

   $$
   \text{COF} = \frac{\text{Number of predictions with } |\hat{y}_i - y_i| > \delta}{n}
   $$

   where \( \delta \) is a predefined threshold.

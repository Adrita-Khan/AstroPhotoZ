**Photometric vs. Spectroscopic Analysis**

| **Feature**           | **Photometry**                                                                 | **Spectroscopy**                                                                  |

| **Definition**         | Measures the intensity or brightness of light integrated over a broad wavelength range. | Analyzes the distribution of light intensity as a function of wavelength (spectrum). |
| **Data Output**        | Light curves, total flux, and magnitudes.                                      | Spectral lines, detailed wavelength-dependent data.                              |
| **Resolution**         | Low resolution; provides broad-band information.                              | High resolution; captures fine details of light across wavelengths.             |
| **Applications**       | Identifying variability in stars, measuring brightness, and estimating distances. | Determining chemical composition, velocity, temperature, and redshift.          |
| **Advantages**         | Faster, simpler, and cheaper; effective for large surveys and basic measurements. | Provides detailed physical and chemical properties of objects.                   |
| **Limitations**        | Lacks detailed spectral information; subject to contamination in broad filters. | More complex, time-consuming, and requires advanced instrumentation.            |
| **Instrumentation**    | Uses photometers or CCD cameras with broad-band filters.                      | Requires spectrographs or diffraction grating for wavelength separation.         |
| **Typical Use Cases**  | Measuring exoplanet transits, supernova searches, and galaxy surveys.          | Studying stellar atmospheres, galaxy kinematics, and interstellar medium.        |
| **Precision**          | Lower precision for detailed properties.                                       | Higher precision for detailed analysis.                                          |

Both techniques are complementary in astrophysics and are often used together to maximize the understanding of celestial objects.
